# World Happiness Index Presentation

This is an example of a slide deck I created as part of a project for a Data Analysis course in Spring 2023. The assignment asked us to collect and analyze data to produce two visuals. 

My project looks at the relationship between happiness scores and levels of social support as well as the relationship between perceived level of freedom and perceived levels of government corruption. I gathered data from Kaggle where it had originally been pulled from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network's publication on world happiness rankings. I did XYZ to clean it. 

Files for the project:
- 'data.csv' replication data
- 'slidescript.Rmd' code for creating the slides
- 'index.html' with the output
