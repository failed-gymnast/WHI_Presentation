# World Happiness Index Presentation

This is an example of a slide deck I created as part of a project for a Data Analysis course in Spring 2023. The assignment asked us to find a data set and analyze it to produce two visuals. 

My project analyzes the World Happiness Index data set and looks at the relationship between happiness scores and levels of social support. It also analyzes the relationship between perceived level of freedom and perceived levels of government corruption. I found the data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usamabuttar/world-happiness-report-2005-present) where it had originally been pulled from the [Sustainable Development Solutions Network's] (https://resources.unsdsn.org/happiness-and-well-being) publication on world happiness rankings. This data set tracks the national averages of survey responses from 165 countries over the course of several years. I did only analyzed a subset of the data from the year 2021, which narrowed the number of observations to 120 countries. I also grouped countries by region.

Files for the project:
- 'World Happiness Report.csv' replication data
- 'Presentation 2.Rmd' code for creating the slides
- 'index.html' produces the output
